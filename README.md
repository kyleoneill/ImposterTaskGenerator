# Imposter Task Generator
A simple electron Node app that generates a realistic crew member task list for imposters in the video game Among Us.

Benefits over the in-game display
- The in-game display shows all possible tasks possible for the current map, this list gives a set number of tasks that mirrors what the crew members receive making tasks easier to fake.
- Faked tasks can be tracked by the app giving you an already constructed alibi when questioned about what tasks you have done and what order you did them in.
- Tracking faked tasks will prevent you from faking the same task multiple times and being called out on it.
- The app displays which tasks are common and visual, giving the imposter a warning for the tasks that can signal to the crew that you are lying.
